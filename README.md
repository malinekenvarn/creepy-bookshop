# Creepy Bookshop

**This is a project for the course Digital Imaging for the Web taken at Mid Sweden University**

## About the project

The projects objective is to create a webshop and make all the images to illustrate the products. 

- All images must be my own photos or created by myself in some way
- The site must contain a slideshow
- The site must contain a video

## About Creepy Bookshop

This is a fictive bookshop. I choose a name that makes you think of creepy pasta. The logotype is a skull with glasses and a bowtie. The site contain HTML and CSS
to show off the images, and some JavaScript to show and hide some fields when you click on things. The JavaScript for the slideshow is from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_slideshow_auto) and I have made minor changes to suit my code.

This is a design assignment, so it has no backend. I have plans for this though, to add functionality along the way when I learn these things.

I have made this site in Swedish because the books I had to work with had Swedish titles, maybe I remake this in English when I add the backend.

## What you see on the site

- Photos of existing books, taken by a crappy mobile camera. I have edited these in Photopea to make them acceptable.

- The fictive novel "Fun City". I've made a bookcover, trailer, and slideshow banner from photos and videos that I took in an abandoned amusement park.

- The fictive novel "Min vän Arne" (in english "My friend Arne"), showing in a slideshow banner. This photo is also taken in the amusement park, in the dollhouse.

- The fictive novel "Mörkaste Småland" (in english "Darkest Småland") can be seen as a teaser photo in the article section of the starter page. I may someday write some of those fictive novels 

- Zombie Alice is actually a webcomic I made for 10 years ago.
